# Memory Game
A simple game with two levels of difficulty - just click each color without clicking the same color twice! The squares randomize location each time a color is clicked, so players need to remember previously chosen colors to avoid repeating clicks. The high score for each mode is tracked seperately, and is remembered while toggling between game modes.
### Easy Mode
8 squares with the same colors every time. A good warmup mode for beginners.
### Hard Mode
12 squares of randomly generated colors. No two colors will be identical, but close matches are common. A new set of colors will be generated for each new game.
